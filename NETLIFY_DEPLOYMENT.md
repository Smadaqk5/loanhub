This guide will help you deploy your LoanHub Kenya application to Netlify.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

- Netlify account (free tier available)
- GitHub account (to connect your repository)
- Supabase project (optional - for production database)

## üìã Pre-deployment Checklist

### 1. Fix Build Issues ‚úÖ
- [x] Fixed TypeScript errors in mock Supabase client
- [x] Updated ESLint configuration to be less strict
- [x] Fixed all build compilation errors

## üåê Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix build issues and add Netlify configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify Build Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   ‚úÖ Should complete successfully with warnings only

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Go to Netlify**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign in or create an account

2. **Connect Repository**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
   - Select your repository
   - Choose the branch (usually `main`)

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Node version: `18` (set in netlify.toml)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for the build to complete

#### Option B: Manual Deploy

1. **Build Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Drag and drop the `.next` folder
   - Or use Netlify CLI:
     ```bash
     npm install -g netlify-cli
     netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next
     ```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go to Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - Add the following variables:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-site-name.netlify.app
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-site-name.netlify.app
   ```

2. **Redeploy**
   - After adding environment variables, trigger a new deployment
   - Go to Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy

## üîß Configuration Files

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"

[[headers]]
  for = "/_next/static/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/favicon.ico"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=86400"
```

### next.config.ts
```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
};

export default nextConfig;
```

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Authentication pages load
- [ ] Loan application form works
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads (if accessible)

### 2. Environment Variables Test

- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify Supabase connection (if configured)
- [ ] Test authentication flow

### 3. Performance Tests

- [ ] Page load times are acceptable
- [ ] Images and assets load quickly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   - Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript errors

2. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Ensure variables are set in Netlify dashboard
   - Redeploy after adding variables
   - Check variable names match exactly

3. **404 Errors on Refresh**
   - This is normal for client-side routing
   - Netlify redirects should handle this
   - Check netlify.toml redirects configuration

4. **Supabase Connection Issues**
   - Verify Supabase URL and keys
   - Check CORS settings in Supabase
   - Ensure Supabase project is active

### Build Logs

- Check Netlify build logs for specific errors
- Look for TypeScript compilation errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed

## üìä Post-Deployment

### 1. Domain Configuration

- **Custom Domain**: Add your domain in Site settings
- **SSL Certificate**: Automatically provided by Netlify
- **DNS**: Update your domain's DNS records

### 2. Monitoring

- **Netlify Analytics**: Enable in Site settings
- **Build Notifications**: Set up email notifications
- **Error Tracking**: Consider adding Sentry or similar

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **CDN**: Netlify provides global CDN automatically
- **Caching**: Configured in netlify.toml
- **Image Optimization**: Consider using Next.js Image component

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### Automatic Deploys

- Every push to main branch triggers a new deployment
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Rollback to previous deployments if needed

### Manual Deploys

- Trigger deploys from Netlify dashboard
- Deploy specific branches
- Deploy from local builds

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### Free Tier Limits

- 100GB bandwidth per month
- 300 build minutes per month
- 1 concurrent build

### Paid Plans

- Higher bandwidth limits
- More build minutes
- Priority support
- Advanced features

## üéâ Success!

Your LoanHub Kenya application should now be live on Netlify! 

**Next Steps:**
1. Test all functionality
2. Configure custom domain (optional)
3. Set up monitoring and analytics
4. Consider upgrading to paid plan for production use

---

**Note**: This deployment uses mock authentication and data. For production use, you'll need to:
1. Set up a real Supabase database
2. Configure proper authentication
3. Add real payment processing
4. Implement proper security measures
